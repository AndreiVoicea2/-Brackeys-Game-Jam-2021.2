<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Project made in one week and published for the "Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2" contest (August 22nd 2021 at 1:00 PM to August 29th 2021 at 1:00 PM). This is a simple clicker game in which you have to defend a point from some enemies that are constantly coming towards it. I also had the opportunity to develop the path finding functionality and certain characteristics of the enemies through which they can interact with the player.


### Built With

Program developed in Unity 2021 with the help of Visual Studio 2019, written in the c# language.

## Getting Started

* The functionality of the game is simple, each level starts with some waves of enemies. They can be destroyed by clicking on them. You have to defend the middle point of the level, the player having a set percentage of life. After each defeated level, a menu appears where you can continue to the next level or go to the store to improve the damage for each click, skills or unlock new skills with the money that each enemy offers after it is destroyed. There are two abilities with which the game starts, each costing a certain number of coins to be used, having a delay after each use. The first ability has the effect of an explosion that damages all enemies that appear on the screen, and the second ability has the effect of slowing down time.
